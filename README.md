# A'pieu cosmetic brand

Hello guys. How's it going? I'm always with computer. It would be my best friend. 
This time, I make clone website of 'A'pieu'.
Do you know this brand? It is korean cosmetic brand named A'pieu, korean is 어퓨.

Original is https://www.apieu.com/kr/index.
Mine is https://bitnana.github.io/apieu/.

Q. Why you choose thise website?

A. I want to try a lot of events I haven't tried yet. Especially, i'm interested in scroll event.
   Moreover, Twice is a model of this brand. I think the main reason is Twice. 
   
Q. Tell features of your clone site.

A. On main page, you can find that most tags has scroll event. So, I make code first. And it is applied to them by SCSS.
   It was my first time to use SCSS. I think it is very useful to apply same css to many tags at once.
   
   This time, I use Youtube API. I learn how to use it by myself. Watching youtube and searching on google.
   Through this experience, I got confidence in using codes that I don't make. 
   I was little bit afraid of that. Because Using code I made is much easier than that of other made. 
   There are a lot of APIs I have to use like map, graph and so on. 
   This clone site makes me more confident.
   
   
   
   
   

I copy this website to develop my skill.
